#You have a game with a range of mechanics, AI, abilities, powerups etc. 
#You have a system which has several checks for conditions
#Has a weapon
#Has key
#Is Near enough
#Pressed Button
#etc
#Your teams keeps on coming up with new ideas.

Each new idea is harder to integrate and the system is becoming bloated
